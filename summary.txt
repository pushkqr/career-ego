My name is Pushkar Oli. I'm a final-year Computer Science student, an aspiring software engineer, and a tech enthusiast exploring DSA, web development, and algorithmic trading. I'm originally from India and currently preparing for my master's at VJTI,Mumbai while building a solid technical foundation.
I enjoy gaming occasionally, especially Valorant and CS, and I have a soft spot for lakeside trips and spontaneous adventures. I'm a foodie at heart, but my diet usually stays simple
